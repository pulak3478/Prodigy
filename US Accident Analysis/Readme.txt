Data Analysis and Visualization Report
1. Data Overview
The dataset contains detailed information about various incidents with the following columns:

Incident Details: ID, Source, Severity, Start_Time, End_Time, Start_Lat, Start_Lng, End_Lat, End_Lng, Distance(mi)

Location Details: Street, City, County, State, Zipcode, Country, Timezone, Airport_Code

Weather Conditions: Weather_Timestamp, Temperature(F), Wind_Chill(F), Humidity(%), Pressure(in), Visibility(mi), Wind_Direction, Wind_Speed(mph), Precipitation(in), Weather_Condition

Road Attributes: Amenity, Bump, Crossing, Give_Way, Junction, No_Exit, Railway, Roundabout, Station, Stop, Traffic_Calming, Traffic_Signal, Turning_Loop

Time of Day: Sunrise_Sunset, Civil_Twilight, Nautical_Twilight, Astronomical_Twilight


2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

Missing Values: Handling missing values in columns like End_Lat, End_Lng.

Data Types: Converting date-time columns to appropriate data types for analysis.

Duplicates: Checking for and removing duplicate entries.


3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Severity Distribution
Plotting the distribution of incident severity to understand the proportion of different severity levels.

Weather Conditions Analysis
Exploring the impact of weather conditions on incident severity.


4.Recommendations

Improved Traffic Management: Implementing more effective traffic management systems in high-frequency incident areas.

Weather Preparedness: Enhancing road safety measures during adverse weather conditions.

Infrastructure Improvements: Upgrading road infrastructure, especially at critical points like junctions and signals.


8. Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into the factors influencing road incidents. Further, detailed investigations can help develop targeted strategies to improve road safety and reduce incident occurrences.
